# Mood-Based-Music-Recommender
A Mood-Based Music Recommender is a system that suggests music to users based on their emotional state. It leverages techniques from machine learning, signal processing, computer vision, or natural language processing (depending on the input type) to detect the user's mood, then recommends music that aligns with or complements that mood.

Here‚Äôs a breakdown of how such a project can work, especially for a student/fresher-level project:

---

### üîß Project Workflow
| Step | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 1. Mood Detection | Detect the user's mood using facial expressions (via webcam and deep learning) or by analyzing text (user input or tweets) or even voice. |
| 2. Preprocessing | Clean and prepare the data for emotion classification. |
| 3. Emotion Classification | Use a model (like CNN for images, LSTM for text/voice) to classify the mood into categories like Happy, Sad, Angry, Neutral, etc. |
| 4. Music Mapping | Map each mood to a playlist or music genre using a pre-built database (Spotify API, YouTube links, or a local song directory). |
| 5. Music Recommendation | Suggest or play music from the mood-mapped playlist. Optionally, show a UI with a mood label and a "Play" button. |

### üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack (Example)
| Component | Tool/Library |
|----------|---------------|
| Mood Detection (Image) | OpenCV, TensorFlow/Keras, CNN |
| Mood Detection (Text) | NLP with NLTK/spaCy, sentiment analysis |
| Music Access | Spotify API, YouTube API, Local MP3 files |
| Backend | Python |
| Frontend/UI | Tkinter (desktop), Streamlit (web) |
| Dataset | FER-2013 (for face emotions), IMDb reviews (for text) |

### üéØ Example Mood to Music Mapping
| Mood | Genre/Playlist |
|------|----------------|
| Happy | Pop, Dance |
| Sad | Soft Rock, Acoustic |
| Angry | Rock, Heavy Metal |
| Relaxed | Instrumental, Lo-fi |
| Excited | EDM, Hip-Hop |
